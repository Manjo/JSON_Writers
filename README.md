To-do: 
-----

- Reformat the items into a seperate JSON file - Eventually I would like to pull items from rails database, this is one of the first steps in preparing for this.

- Code a less intensive way of repopulating the shop - Currently it just reloads all images as if it was being reinitialized, could be done more gracefully.
